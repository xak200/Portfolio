This assignment made use of the Quicksort algorithm.
I computed the total number of comparisons the algorithm uses to sort the given input file.
I explored three different rules for choosing pivots:
  1. Always used the first element of the array as the pivot.
  2. Always used the last element of the array as the pivot.
  3. Used the "median-of-three" rule to choose the pivot.
