In this assignment, I wrote an algorithm for computing strongly connected components of the given graph.
The file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. 
Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head.
