This assignment uses JSON, MongoDB, and NoSQL.

Data Scrubbing and Excel Assignment Example:

This assignment uses Python to clean a datafile downloaded from the internet. Excel was then used to parse the data and 
perform an analysis on the data.

Pre-LAMP App Assignment Example:

This assignment consists of the work that prefaced the LAMP assignment. I used SQL to write scripts to populate a mySQL database. 
I implemented the following operations:
- created all of the tables for controlled vocabularies ("reference tables") needed along with the INSERT queries required 
to populate those tables
- created all of the tables that will be used with user data entry and/or imported data files
- populated the second set of tables with test data (a dozen records or so per table would likely suffice for testing purposes) 
and/or a script that imports data from text files

LAMP App Assignment Example:

This assignment uses Linux, PHP, CSS, and HTML. This assignment uses the mySQL database from the Pre-LAMP assignment.

Contains:
+ an opening page to introduce the project
 - a "menu" screen
 - reports based on data in database as follows:
   *  both reports run against a minimum of 2 tables
    *  reports includes hyperlinks
     *  reports includes images
      *  reports that open webpages offer the user a drop-down box allowing the user to determine the field(s) to use for sorting 
  the data in the report
    *  reports include a drop-down user selection on the form that is created using PHP to cull data from a table in MySQL database
    *  reports indicates to the user if no records meet the criteria
