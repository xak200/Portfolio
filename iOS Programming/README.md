# iOS Programming

The sample Swift code creates an application that allows a user to input her/his start location and final destination. The user 
can then add as many tasks/errands as desired to accomplish on her/his route, without going out of her/his way. The user clicks
a '+' button to add a task, and the application filters Yelp results to return only those in the direction the user will
be going.
