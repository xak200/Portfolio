# Apache Spark with Python

I wrote the script entitled finance_urls when my assigned task was to gather two lists:
- one list of different details (bid time, our ID for user, data partner's ID for user, URL) related to each URL associated with finance categories (IAB6, IAB9_18, and IAB13)
- one list of all the unique finance URLs
