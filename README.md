# Portfolio

[iOS Programming](./iOS%20Programming):

In this course, I learned to create applications for Appleâ€™s iOS on both the iPhone and the iPad using Objective-C, 
Apple's new programming language Swift, Apple iOS Frameworks, and the iOS SDK. I built and tested applications on my 
Apple Mac using the Xcode development environment, compiler and simulator. 


-------------------


[Intro to Machine Learning](./Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning):

In this class, I learned about the theoretical foundations of machine learning and how to apply machine learning to solve 
new problems.

Topics covered include:
- Perceptron algorithm
- Support vector machines (Pegasos algorithm)
- Kernel methods
- Learning theory
- Decision Trees
- K-means clustering
- Naive Bayes


-------------------


[Applied Internet Technology](./Applied%20Internet%20Technology):

This folder includes an example of code I wrote for a class project that uses Mongo, Mongoose, Node, JavaScript, Express, 
CSS, and HTML. I implemented a restaurant website, which supplies potential or returning customers with contact information 
and menus. Customers are also able to write reviews through the website.


-------------------


[Database Design & Implementation](./Database%20Design%20%26%20Implementation):

This folder contains SQL, NoSQL, PHP, and JSON code I wrote in my database class, using the mySQL and Mongo databases, and Linux.
I've included two sample assignments. The MongoDB assignment reads high school students' AP scores from a JSON file into a 
MongoDB collection. It answers seven questions related to this data.
The LAMP assignment is an online database application 


-------------------


[Operating Systems](./Operating%20Systems):

This course focused on the core concepts of operating systems, covering: 
- processes and threads
- concurrency and synchronization, deadlocks and preventions
- memory management, virtual memory and computer architecture facilitating it (pagetables, segmentation)
- file systems and secondary storage

The samples include Java code for a linker, and C++ code for memory management.
