# Machine Learning

The sample Python code implements the Perceptron algorithm and applies it to the problem of e-mail spam classification. 
The dataset included for this exercise is based on a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus. The code trains, validates, and
tests the model using a training set of 4,000 e-mails, a validation set of 1,000 e-mails, and a test set of 5,000 e-mails.
The vocabulary list ignored all words that appeared in less than 30 e-mails of the training set.
