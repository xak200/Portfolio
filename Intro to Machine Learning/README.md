# Machine Learning

The sample Python code takes a CSV file as input and filters the data. The data is normalized then split into a feature 
matrix and a labels matrix. This code outputs those processed matrices. 

This code was written as part of a group project. My role was to process the data, so that is what the published code does.
My professor did not want me to publish my code for homework problems.
